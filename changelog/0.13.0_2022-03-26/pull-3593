Enhancement: Improve `copy` performance by parallelizing IO

Restic copy previously only used a single thread for copying blobs between
repositories, which resulted in limited performance when copying small blobs
to/from a high latency backend (i.e. any remote backend, especially b2).

Copying will now use 8 parallel threads to increase the throughput of the copy
operation.
