Bugfix: Make cache crash-resistant and usable by multiple concurrent processes

The restic cache directory (`RESTIC_CACHE_DIR`) could end up in a broken state
in the event of restic (or the OS) crashing. This is now less likely to occur
as files are downloaded to a temporary location before being moved to their
proper location.

This also allows multiple concurrent restic processes to operate on a single
repository without conflicts. Previously, concurrent operations could cause
segfaults because the processes saw each other's partially downloaded files.
