Enhancement: Add compression support

We've added compression support to the restic repository format. To create a
repository using the new format run `init --repository-version 2`. Please note
that the repository cannot be read by restic versions prior to 0.14.0.

You can configure whether data is compressed with the option `--compression`. It
can be set to `auto` (the default, which will compress very fast), `max` (which
will trade backup speed and CPU usage for better compression), or `off` (which
disables compression). Each setting is only applied for the current run of restic
and does *not* apply to future runs. The option can also be set via the
environment variable `RESTIC_COMPRESSION`.

To upgrade in place run `migrate upgrade_repo_v2` followed by `prune`. See the
documentation for more details. The migration checks the repository integrity
and upgrades the repository format, but will not change any data. Afterwards,
prune will rewrite the metadata to make use of compression.

As an alternative you can use the `copy` command to migrate snapshots; First
create a new repository using
`init --repository-version 2 --copy-chunker-params --repo2 path/to/old/repo`,
and then use the `copy` command to copy all snapshots to the new repository.
