Bugfix: Make SFTP backend report no space left on device

Backing up to an SFTP backend would spew repeated SSH_FX_FAILURE messages when
the remote disk was full. Restic now reports "sftp: no space left on device"
and exits immediately when it detects this condition.

A fix for this issue was implemented in restic 0.12.1, but unfortunately the
fix itself contained a bug that prevented it from taking effect.
