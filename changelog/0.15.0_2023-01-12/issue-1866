Enhancement: Improve handling of directories with duplicate entries

If for some reason a directory contains a duplicate entry, the `backup` command
would previously fail with a `node "path/to/file" already present` or `nodes
are not ordered got "path/to/file", last "path/to/file"` error.

The error handling has been improved to only report a warning in this case. Make
sure to check that the filesystem in question is not damaged if you see this!
